# EEG-Confusin-Level-Detection
This project aims on different classification algorithms which can classify whether the student is in a confusion state or not using an EEG data set. The data set was collected from 10 students using an EEG headset while watching educational video clips.
This is a part of my final year research project - Initial Phase
